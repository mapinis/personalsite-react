# personalsite-react

A react-based static personalsite. The react part of it all is mainly for my practice, the cool parts aren't that useful for this site.

Main branch built with phenomic, gatsby branch written with gatsby. Right now, it looks like gatsby is the way I am going to go, but I have not yet decided.

Currently contentless.
